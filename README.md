# Unknown Detections - Microverse final capstone project.

The world is a big place and strange places/objects are everywhere.
This React web app servers as a platform to look for posts of strange places or things found by other people around the world.

## Usage

This app counts with fully integrated JWT user authentication to save all those strange places or places where strange objects are found just click the favorite button to add them to your favorites list. Nevertheless, all posts can be viewed by no authenticated users.

It also counts with a search box to look for any post you want by just typing its title or part of it.

So, if you want to save those places/objects that sound interesting in visiting on your next vacation, do not doubt to sign in!.
